## Description
Vinovation is a Django-based web application designed to assist wine producers in managing their wine inventory effectively. With a user-friendly interface, the application allows users to track their wines from reception to bottling, manage vessels, and perform detailed analyses. The project was inspired by extensive experience in the wine production industry, aiming to simplify the daunting task of wine management.

## Functionality
- **User Authentication:** Users can create an account, log in, and manage their own wine inventory.
- **Dashboard:** An overview of all wines created by the user, providing quick access to details and actions.
- **Wine Detail Page:** Displays comprehensive information about each wine, including fermentation details, analysis, movements, current vessel, and additions. Users can edit or delete wine entries.
- **Create Wine Batch:** A form for users to add new wine lots, including fields for variety, volume or tonnage, vineyard, vessel, and lab analysis.
- **Vessels Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete vessels (e.g., stainless steel tanks or oak barrels).
- **Analysis Management:** Users can add, edit, and delete analyses related to their wines.
